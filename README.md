[Spock Framework](https://code.google.com/p/spock/ "Spock Framework Home Page") Labs
====================

These labs were put together for the purpose of helping people learn more about the 
[Spock Framework](https://code.google.com/p/spock/ "Spock Framework Home Page"). There are two labs
that users can build upon. One based on the [Grails](http://grails.org/ "Grails Home Page") framework and the other 
based on [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/ "Dropwizard Home Page"). Both of the labs are built using the 
Groovy programming language.
